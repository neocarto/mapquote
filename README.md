**The World Map of Cartographic Quotations**

## General arguments: 
If, like us, your life is punctuated by novels that follow you throughout the day, and sometimes even during the night.
 If some of them are good, others less so, some are to be forgotten while others make you think for years, make you dream for hours, remake the World.
 
Sometimes in these stories, there is also a question of maps and cartography. 
At the heart of the intrigue sometimes; more often at the turn of a sentence.
Simple reference or fine description, figure of style or metaphor, many novels evoke cartography. 
So there are many potential citations.

>> It is this anthology of quotations dealing with cartographic topics that we aim to gather here through the **MapQuote project**. 

## Presentation:
**MapQuote** is a free project initiated by FranÃ§oise Bahoken and Nicolas Lambert (to combine usefulness with pleasure).

This project is intended to be a **collective** one. It takes the form of an interactive map based on the cluster method. It
It is based on the _JavaScript Leaflet library_ and has been entirely designed in _R_ language.
